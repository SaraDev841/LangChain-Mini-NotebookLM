# langchain-notebooklm

A NotebookLM-style **grounded research assistant**, built as a project for learning
**LangChain v1**. The code is organized as a finished product, by feature — not by
development stage.


## Stack
- **Chat model:** OpenAI (`openai:gpt-4o` by default)
- **Embeddings:** Cohere (`embed-multilingual-v3.0` by default)
- Everything is provider-agnostic via env vars — see [`.env.example`](.env.example).

## The app

A NotebookLM-style 3-panel workspace, with a real client/server split:

```
┌ Sources ────┬ Chat ───────────────┬ Studio ──────┐
│ add / upload│ grounded answers    │ artifacts    │
│ select      │ with citations      │ + saved notes│
│ view / del  │                     │              │
└─────────────┴─────────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

- **Sources** — add by pasting text or uploading `.md`/`.txt`, toggle which sources are
  active (retrieval is scoped to them), view or remove a source.
- **Chat** — the main product: a single conversational agent for grounded Q&A with
  citations and short-term memory; save any answer to a note.
- **Studio** — generate artifacts: **Infographic · PowerPoint · Summary · FAQ**
  (each will be its own standalone agent; PowerPoint uses a `.pptx` generation skill).

## Structure

```
client/                 web client — single-page HTML/JS/CSS, no build step
src/notebooklm/
  agents/               one agent per feature
    chat.py             the conversational chat agent (tools + short-term memory)
  core/                 config, models, source ingestion, the live SourceStore
  api/                  FastAPI backend: schemas (contract), services, routes
```

The chat is one simple agent with the retrieval tools and memory. The Studio artifact
generators will be standalone, stateless agents (invoked directly by the Studio, not part of
the chat). Capabilities not built yet return `501` and the UI shows a "coming soon" notice.

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env         # fill in OPENAI_API_KEY and COHERE_API_KEY
uv run notebooklm-serve      # then open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

CLI (no server):

```bash
uv run notebooklm "Compare Fleet OS growth between Q1 and Q2."
```

## Feature roadmap

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Retrieval (grounded Q&A) | ✅ done — the `chat` agent's tools |
| Agent + tools | ✅ done — `agents/chat.py` |
| Short-term memory | ✅ done — checkpointer + `thread_id` on the chat agent |
| Structured output (Studio artifacts) | ⏳ planned |
| Event streaming | ⏳ planned |
| Middlewares | ⏳ planned |
| Guardrails | ⏳ planned |
| Human in the loop | ⏳ planned |
| MCP | ⏳ planned |

The sample corpus under [`src/notebooklm/data`](src/notebooklm/data) is a fictional company
("Acme Robotics") so the app runs out of the box.
